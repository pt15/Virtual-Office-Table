The purpose of the project was to provide some of the services that an average office worker requires all in one place,
such as checking any unread emails, accessing their google drive, making notes on the go and a scheduler to store
reminders.

This project was made as a part of the course IT Workshop 2, and the team that worked on it comprised of 4 members:

Swati Dewan
